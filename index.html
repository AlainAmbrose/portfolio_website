      <p class="introduction">
        I'm a student at the University of Central Florida Majoring in Computer
        Science with a minor in Intelligent Robotic Systems.
      </p>
      <p class="introduction">
        I started seriously learning and applying computer science concepts
        right before college. Since that point I have worked every day to get
        better with my problem solving, critical thinking, communication skills,
        and teamwork. I'm committed to putting in effort to learn through
        internship experience and am looking forward to growing as I move
        forward.
